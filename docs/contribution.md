# Contributing to Joinup

## How to contribute
Contribution to Joinup is similar to most other projects on GitHub:
We use the [fork and pull](https://help.github.com/articles/types-of-collaborative-development-models/) model, which means that everyone whom wants to contribute, can do so through a pull request from a fork of Joinup towards the Joinup repository.
For more information on pull requests you can review the [using pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) page.
However, before submitting any pull request, we kindly ask you to sign the [Joinup Individual Contributor Assignment Agreement](agreement.md) and to send it to Joinup legal support, by [submitting the contact form](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/contact).
We also ask you to read and adhere to the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md)

 
## Legal
 The Joinup codebase is released under the [European Union Public Licence (EUPL)](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/eupl/og_page/eupl), and so must all code provide in a pull request.
