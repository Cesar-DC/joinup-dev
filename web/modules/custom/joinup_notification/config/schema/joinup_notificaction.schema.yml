# Config schema for the notification settings.
#
# There are two arrays in the config settings of joinup notification, the
# transition_notifications and the delete_notifications.
#
# The transition notifications are message ids indexed by the role, transition
# and workflow group as shown below.
# @code
# $config = [
#   solution => [
#     request_deletion => [
#       moderator => [
#         message_id
#       ]
#     ]
#   ]
# ]
# There can be multiple message ids and the roles are either site-wide or og.
#
# The delete_notifications array is not depending on states so it is has the
# same approach but uses the entity type id instead of the workflow group and
# the bundle instead of the transition.
# @code
# $config = [
#   rdf_entity => [
#     collection => [
#       moderator => [
#         message_id
#       ]
#     ]
#   ]
# ]
