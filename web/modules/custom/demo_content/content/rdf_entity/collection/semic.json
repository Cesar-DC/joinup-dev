It means that, in the context of an information exchange, the receiver and the sender of information can understand and interpret it the same way. The lack of semantic interoperability between European e-Government systems is one of the major obstacles in the provision of cross-border and cross-sector digital public services.&nbsp;<\/p>\n        <p>Dr. Vassilios Peristeras, Programme officer of ISA&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/isa\/actions\/01-trusted-information-exchange\/1-1action_en.htm\">Action 1.1<\/a>&nbsp;explains the action\u2019s vision for semantic interoperability, which boils down to the establishment of common agreements on the meaning of different entities, e.g. basic data about persons, businesses or addresses, exchanged in the context of cross-border and\/or cross-sector information exchanges.<\/p>\n        <h3>SEMIC activities<\/h3>\n        <p>SEMIC focuses on the following activities:<\/p>\n        <h4>Development and promotion of Core Vocabularies<\/h4>\n        <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/joinup.ec.europa.eu\/node\/102288\">e-Government Core Vocabularies<\/a>&nbsp;are simplified, re-usable and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity, such as a person, a business, a location or a public service, in a context-neutral way.

Structural metadata indicates how compound objects are put together. It can consist of among others data models, reference data, and identifier schemas\u201d.<br \/>\n        SEMIC has established an international Community of Practice which is working on specifications, good practices and lessons learned for setting up proper governance and management of data standards, and for selecting the right support tools. Such activities will greatly enhance the potential for coordination and interoperability between public administrations in the context of cross-border and\/or cross-sector information exchanges.<br \/>\n        Read more about the Community of Practice on data standards <a href=\"https:\/\/joinup.ec.europa.eu\/node\/109954\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n        <h4><br \/>\n        Exploring Linked Open Government Data (LOGD)<\/h4>\n        <p><br \/>\n        Linked Data enables the provision of \u201cdata as a service\u201d and conceives the Web as an open ecosystem where data owners, data publishers, and data consumers can interconnect and integrate disparate datasets.
