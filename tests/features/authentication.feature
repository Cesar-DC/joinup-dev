Feature: User authentication
  In order to protect the integrity of the website
  As a product owner
  I want to make sure users with various roles can only access pages they are authorized to

  Background:
    Given collections:
      | name                        | uri               |
      | Ãœberwaldean Land Eels       | http://drupal.org |

  Scenario: Anonymous user can see the user login page
    Given I am not logged in
    When I visit "user"
    Then I should see the text "Log in"
    And I should see the text "Reset your password"
    And I should see the text "Username"
    And I should see the text "Password"
    But I should not see the text "Log out"
    And I should not see the text "My account"

  Scenario Outline: Anonymous user can access public pages
    Given I am not logged in
    Then I visit "<path>"

    Examples:
      | path                           |
      | rdf_entity/http%3A\\drupal.org |

    Given I am not logged in
    When I go to "<path>"
    Then I should get an access denied error
