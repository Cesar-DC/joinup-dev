Feature: User authentication
  In order to protect the integrity of the website
  I want to make sure proper permissions are given to appropriate roles

  Background:
    Given collections:
      | name                        | author          | uri               |
      | Ãœberwaldean Land Eels       | Arnold Sideways | http://drupal.org |

  Scenario: Anonymous user can see the user login page and a collection homepage
    Given I am not logged in
    When I visit "user"
    Then I should see the text "Log in"
    And I should see the text "Reset your password"
    And I should see the text "Username"
    And I should see the text "Password"
    But I should not see the text "Log out"
    And I should not see the text "My account"
